# Description

The script automates the installation or updating of an existing phpstorm installation on a unix machine (tested on Debian Linux 6 and 7).

The script itself is very verbose. If something happens, it should support you.
Furthermore, the script is creating a backup of your existing installation and outputs the backup path.

# Usage 

```
# first of all, go to the [download page](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/download/) and download the newest version
# simple install or update
php phpstorm.php path/to/linux/php/version.tar.gz 

# install or update and change group
#   good if you created a "developer" group on your system
php phpstorm.php path/to/linux/php/version.tar.gz your_group_name
```
